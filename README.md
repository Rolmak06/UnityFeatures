# Unity Features 
Here are gathered some Unity Features I've had to create for my projects. I have decided to drop them here for my future self.
Avoiding repetitive scripting allows me to focus on enhancing those scripts and logics. 

## [Damage System](DamageSystem)
By using an interface, I've created a simple and yet robust health/damage framework. This showcase the practice of single-responsability and dependency inversion principles.

## [Unity Event System](Events)
Based on Unity Callbacks and Unity Events, this little framework can be used to do quick and fast prototypes iterations. I mainly use this for modular staging or to crash test functionalities.

## [State Machine](StateMachine) 
Base State Machine framework using abstract classes and states. This will be expanded with examples in the future. I already used this base in Bad Dreams to create a very reactive and versatile Zombie AI.
